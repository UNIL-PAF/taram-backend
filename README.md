# Taram

Taram is a web-based proteomics analysis pipeline developed at the [Protein Analysis Facility UNIL](https://wp.unil.ch/paf/).

Currently it supports results generated by [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org/) and [Spectronaut](https://biognosys.com/software/spectronaut/).

It consists of 3 different parts:
- [Taram backend](https://github.com/UNIL-PAF/taram-backend): the API written in Kotlin and R
- [Taram user-interface](): the web-interface which is written using [ReactJS]().
- [Tara svg](): a simple NodeJS API which is used to render the plots for the PDF exports.

## Taram backend

The backend of Taram is mainly written in Kotlin and based on the SpringBoot framework.

It uses a MySQL database.
